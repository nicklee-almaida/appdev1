Examples
In Education: Stanford SMILE

Stanford University developed the SMILE (Stanford Mobile Inquiry-Based Learning Environment) platform to enhance classroom learning using mobile and IoT technologies. Students use mobile devices to generate, share, and answer questions, while teachers use real-time data analytics to monitor student engagement. SMILE has been adopted globally, particularly in under-resourced schools, to support active learning and critical thinking through technology.
